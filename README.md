In this project I did some experiments with <a href="https://socket.io/" target="_blank">socket.io</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>
<br/>
Next JS webpack 5 used here and version 11 because of bugs in version 12.

Socket.io was hosted in replit and then used in the frontend...
